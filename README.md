Welcome to my Simple Chatbot project! This repository contains the code for a basic chatbot designed to handle common interactions like greetings and expressions of thanks. 
This project serves as an introductory example of how to build a chatbot, showcasing the fundamentals of conversational AI.

As part of my journey in developing more advanced AI models, specifically focusing on creating a large language model (LLM), this simple chatbot demonstrates the basic principles of 
conversational AI with easy-to-understand code and structure. It is designed to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements and expansions. 
Contributions are welcome, and I encourage you to fork this repository and build upon it.
